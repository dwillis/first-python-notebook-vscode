About this class
================

This course was first developed by `Ben Welsh <https://palewi.re/who-is-ben-welsh/>`_ for an October 2016, `"watchdog workshop" <http://www.californiacivicdata.org/2016/10/08/first-python-notebook/>`_ organized by Investigative Reporters and Editors at San Diego State University's school of journalism.

It was revised for a February 2017 hands-on training of students at Stanford's journalism school and expanded into `a six-hour class <https://www.ire.org/events-and-training/event/2702/2879/>`_ at the annual conference of the National Institute for Computer-Assisted Reporting in March 2017.

It was expanded into its current form for `a massive open online course <https://knightcenter.utexas.edu/blog/00-18396-sign-now-our-new-online-course-data-journalism-python-data-journalists-analyzing-money>`_ offered by the Knight Center for Journalism in the Americas in May 2017.

Since then, it has been taught at five consecutive NICAR conferences and included as part of Stanfordâ€™s curriculum. Several classes have been streamed live, with one `available as a recording <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-y7tRpq7xM>`_.

The class has frequently been with and by others, including `James Gordon <https://journalism.missouri.edu/people/james-gordon/>`_, `Andrea Suozzo <https://andreasuozzo.com/>`_, `Cheryl Phillips <https://comm.stanford.edu/faculty-phillips/>`_, `Iris Lee <https://www.latimes.com/people/iris-lee>`_, `Melissa Lewis <https://melissalewis.codes/>`_, `Aaron Williams <https://acwx.net/>`_, `Derek Willis <http://thescoop.org/>`_, `Joe Germuska <https://about.me/joegermuska>`_, `Kae Petrin <https://www.chalkbeat.org/authors/kae-petrin>`_, `Serdar Tumgoren <https://twitter.com/zstumgoren>`_, `Simon Willison <https://simonwillison.net/>`_, `David Eads <http://www.recoveredfactory.net/>`_ and `Amy Schmitz Weiss <https://californiacivicdata.org/2017/07/12/first-python-notebook-at-sdsu/>`_.
