# About this class

This course was first developed by [Ben Welsh](https://palewi.re/who-is-ben-welsh/) for an October 2016, ["watchdog workshop"](http://www.californiacivicdata.org/2016/10/08/first-python-notebook/) organized by Investigative Reporters and Editors at San Diego State University's school of journalism.

It was revised for a February 2017 hands-on training of students at Stanford's journalism school and expanded into [a six-hour class](https://www.ire.org/events-and-training/event/2702/2879/) at the annual conference of the National Institute for Computer-Assisted Reporting in March 2017.

It was grew into its current form for [a massive open online course](https://knightcenter.utexas.edu/blog/00-18396-sign-now-our-new-online-course-data-journalism-python-data-journalists-analyzing-money) offered by the Knight Center for Journalism in the Americas in May 2017.

Since then, it has been taught at an unbroken string of NICAR conferences and included as part of Stanfordâ€™s curriculum. Several classes have been streamed live, with one [available as a recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-y7tRpq7xM).

The class has frequently been taught with and by others, including [James Gordon](https://journalism.missouri.edu/people/james-gordon/), [Andrea Suozzo](https://andreasuozzo.com/), [Cheryl Phillips](https://comm.stanford.edu/faculty-phillips/), [Iris Lee](https://www.latimes.com/people/iris-lee), [Melissa Lewis](https://melissalewis.codes/), [Aaron Williams](https://acwx.net/), [Derek Willis](http://thescoop.org/), [Joe Germuska](https://about.me/joegermuska), [Kae Petrin](https://www.chalkbeat.org/authors/kae-petrin), [Eric Sagara](https://www.linkedin.com/in/esagara), [Serdar Tumgoren](https://twitter.com/zstumgoren), [Simon Willison](https://simonwillison.net/), [David Eads](http://www.recoveredfactory.net/) and [Amy Schmitz Weiss](https://californiacivicdata.org/2017/07/12/first-python-notebook-at-sdsu/).
