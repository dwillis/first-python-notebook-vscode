# About this class

This course was first developed by [Ben Welsh](https://palewi.re/who-is-ben-welsh/) for an October 2016 ["watchdog workshop"](http://www.californiacivicdata.org/2016/10/08/first-python-notebook/) organized by Investigative Reporters and Editors at San Diego State University's school of journalism.

Since then it has grown into a six-hour, hands-on training that has been taught as a massive, open online course [at the University of Texas at Austin](https://knightcenter.utexas.edu/blog/00-18396-sign-now-our-new-online-course-data-journalism-python-data-journalists-analyzing-money), become part of Stanfordâ€™s curriculum and been offered at an unbroken string of annual conferences organized by the National Institute for Computer-Assisted Reporting. Several classes have been streamed live, with [more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-y7tRpq7xM) than [one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RgPoy05AnA) available as a recording.
