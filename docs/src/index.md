# First Python Notebook (VS Code Edition)

A step-by-step guide to analyzing data with Python and Visual Studio Code.

## What you will learn

* Just enough of the [Python](https://www.python.org/) computer-programming language to read, filter, join, group, aggregate and rank structured data with [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/), a popular tool for statistical analysis

* How to record, remix and republish your work using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), Microsoft's popular code editor with excellent Python support and integrated notebook features

* How to explore data using [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/), a Python package that offers a simple, structured grammar for generating charts

## Who can take it

This course is free. All you need is a good attitude.

## How to follow along

This tutorial offers **two ways** to learn:

1. **ðŸ“– Traditional tutorial**: Follow the step-by-step markdown chapters below
2. **ðŸ““ Interactive notebooks**: Use the complete collection of Jupyter notebooks in VS Code

The notebooks provide a hands-on, interactive experience where you can run code directly and see results immediately. The traditional chapters are better for reading through concepts and quick reference.
