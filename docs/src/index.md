# First Python Notebook

A step-by-step guide to analyzing data with Python and the Jupyter notebook.

## What you will learn

* Just enough of the [Python](https://www.python.org/) computer-programming language to read, filter, join, group, aggregate and rank structured data with [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/), a popular tool for statistical analysis

* How to record, remix and republish your work using [Project Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/), the emerging standard for generating reproducible research

* How to explore data using using [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/), a Python package that offers a simple, structured grammar for generating charts.

## Who can take it

This course is free. All you need is a good attitude.
